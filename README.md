# Anomalous sound detection for industrial machine based on supervised CNN with various feature extraction methods (STFT, MFCC, Mel-spectrogram, GFCC)
[ECE381K_AML_term_project]

In this study, we develop a method to detect abnormal sounds from audio data recorded for various machine types, models, and SNRs. The dataset we used comes from the [MIMII dataset]: https://zenodo.org/records/3384388
