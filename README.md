# Anomaly audio sound detection for machinery based on supervised CNN with various feature extraction methods (STFT, MFCC, Mel-spectrogram, GFCC)
[ECE381K_AML_term_project]

In this study, we develop a method to detect anomalous sound from audio data recored for various machine types, models, and SNR. The dataset we used comes from MIMII dataset (http:// ...).
