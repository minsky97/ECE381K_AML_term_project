# Anomalous Sound Detection for Industrial Machines with Supervised and Unsupervised Learning Algorithms
 - [ECE381K_Term_Project - Group 9]

# Abstract

Anomalous sound detection (ASD) techniques based on machine acoustics have been proposed as alternative and more generalizable methods to prevent mechanical failure for industrial machines. In this study, we extended previous work on anomaly detection methods by exploring four feature extraction methods. We developed ASD methods relying on supervised and unsupervised approaches for four industrial machines from the Malfunctioning Industrial Machine Investigation and Inspection (MIMII) dataset with realistic background noise. By comparing the AUC with a baseline model, we show that a supervised approach performs better, indicating that analyzing the sound of a machine could be a cheaper alternative tool to supplement other sensors in a factory environment once the labels are present. However, we also show that our unsupervised ap-
proach performs poorer than the baseline MIMII model, indicating that further feature extraction and engineering techniques are required.
